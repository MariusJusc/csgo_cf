# CSGO Coinflip

A website application for real-time Counter-Strike: Global Offensive asset coin gambling, based on Steam Platform. It was an ongoing project, before Steam changing its item policies.

The source code includes:
* A layer for dealing with SteamAPI services.
* Steam bot project, for automated tradings.
* A Generic EF Code-First approach database access layer.
* An half-baked interface using SignalR

In order to get it working, it requires a steamAPI key added in "SteamOptions" class.
